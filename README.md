# Dark-Matter-Menu
Dark Matter Menu is a Roblox exploit menu created by one person, me.


# How to use
In order to use this, you will require a roblox executor and, of course, a roblox account (I'd recommend using an alt to avoid getting your main banned).
simply paste the code from main into your executor of choice and click execute or run or whatever it says.


# Executors
SIDE NOTE: DO NOT USE WEAREDEVS TO DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE EXECUTORS, YOU MAY GET A VIRUS.

FREE:
KRNL (Gives alot of spam in email but it works just fine)
Electron (MAY BE A TROJAN I'D RECOMMEND AGAINST USING THIS)
Oxygen U (Insanely good for a free executor, no spam, no virus and it comes with scripts built-in.)
Fluxus (Good alternative to Synapse X, same as Oxygen U)

PAID:
Synapse X (What I use, personally I don't know if its the best but if you can afford it then sure)
NoobHaxx (Absolutely garbage, please do not buy this. Even Electron is better)
Senital (Eh, pretty good. Cheaper alternative to Synapse X)
ProtoSmasher (Really would recommend if you cant afford Synapse X)
SirHurt (Just a mini and cheaper ProtoSmasher)
